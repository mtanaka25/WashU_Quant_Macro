These codes are for the assignments of Economics 5725 (Quantitative Macroeconomic Theory, Fall 2022) at the Washignton University in St. Louis.


## About Economics 5725

Economics 5725 is a PhD lecture taught by Juan M. Sanchez (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis).

The goals of this course are (1) to introduce the basics tools of modern quantitative macroeconomics, and (2) to help us to start working on quantitative macro.
In the course, we are expected to implement models with rich
heterogeneity across agents and firms, aggregate fluctuations, and transitional dynamics.
For the detail of the course, see the syllabus available on [Juan's personal website](https://sites.google.com/view/juanmsanchezweb).


## Programming language
 I basically use Python, which is recommended by the lecturer, for this course's assignemnts. However, I might occasionally use MATLAB when I think it is more suited.


 ## Requirements
I use the latest version of Python and its basic packages (e.g. numpy). For MATLAB codes, I use MATLAB R2022a.

In the codes in `HW1` and `HW2`, I use `freadapi` and `statsmodels` packages, which are not included in standard collections of Python packages. To use `freadapi`, you need to apply a API key to St. Louis Fed. The application is accepted online for free.
